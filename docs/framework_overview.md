# IoTPTF Framework Overview
IoTPTF extends PTES to address IoT-specific challenges, focusing on multi-layer testing across hardware, software, and communication channels. It tackles:
- Firmware vulnerabilities
- Network protocol weaknesses (MQTT, CoAP, Matter, LoRaWAN, etc.)
- Physical security risks (JTAG, UART)
- Emerging threats (AI, Zero Trust, satellite, digital twins, quantum)
